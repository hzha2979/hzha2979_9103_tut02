My inspiration is from the line art version of Scream and the Starry Night. The image technology is turning an image into simple curved lines. Lines look like neon tubes against a dark background in these images. In the individual animation task, I want to use the audio method to control the brightness of these lines for a glowing and flickering effect. The louder the sound captured, the brighter the lines. This would fit in with the name of the painting: Scream

##Part 2: Imaging Technique Inspiration

1. I found shadow effect(or emissive effect) to achieve glowing effect.

2. And noise function to achieve a natural flickering effect of the line.

3. getLevel()function in sound library of p5.js can be used to visualize the input sound. It can returns a single amplitude reading at the moment it is called.
